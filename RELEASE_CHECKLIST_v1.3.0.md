# Release Checklist for Psyne v1.3.0

## Zero-Copy Architecture ✅
- [x] All 6 channel implementations converted to zero-copy
- [x] Ring buffer + offset-based messaging 
- [x] Scatter-gather I/O for network channels
- [x] Modern C++20 API with concepts and spans
- [x] Eliminated all unnecessary memcpy operations

## Code Cleanup ✅
- [x] Removed patterns directory (no more ZMQ/NNG references)
- [x] Updated examples to use `msg.send()` API
- [x] Created clean pattern examples (request/reply, pub/sub)
- [x] Marked experimental features (QUIC, compression) for v2.0
- [x] Added examples README

## Core Features Ready ✅
- [x] SPSC channels with zero atomics
- [x] TCP/UDP/IPC/Unix/WebSocket channels
- [x] WebRTC channels (with acceptable memcpy for network serialization)
- [x] Basic GPU tensor support
- [x] High-performance message types
- [x] Thread-safe multi-producer/consumer modes

## Implement Messaging Patterns
- [ ] Request/Reply
- [ ] Publish/Subscribe
- [X] Dealer/Router (We call it a filtered fanout)
- [ ] Pair

## Code Cleanup
- [ ] Complete all `TODO:` items
- [ ] Find empty methods and stub function or classes - implement them if they are features, or remove them if they are not going to be implemented (e.g. HPC, H100 type features that we can't test)

## Testing Required
- [ ] Run all examples to ensure they compile and work
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS)

## Shortly before updating documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (different patterns, for both M4 and Ryzen 3700X/RTX 3060)

## Documentation
- [ ] Update main README with v1.3.0 features
- [ ] API documentation (Doxygen)
- [ ] Migration guide from older versions
- [ ] Performance tuning guide

## Release Process
- [ ] Tag v1.3.0 in git
- [ ] Update version in CMakeLists.txt (already 1.3.0 ✅)
- [ ] Build release binaries
- [ ] Create GitHub release with notes
- [ ] Notify Psynetics and other users

## Key Selling Points for v1.3.0
1. **True Zero-Copy**: Messages are views into ring buffers
2. **Modern C++20**: Concepts, spans, ranges, consteval
3. **AI/ML Optimized**: Built for tensor transport
4. **High Performance**: SPSC with zero atomics
5. **Clean API**: No legacy messaging system references

## QUIC Transport ✅
- [x] QUIC channel implementation with zero-copy interface
- [x] Factory registration for `quic://` URI scheme
- [x] Basic client/server connection support
- [x] Stream multiplexing interface
- [x] Integration with channel factory

## Deferred to v2.0
- RDMA/InfiniBand
- GPUDirect RDMA  
- Advanced compression
- Kernel bypass (DPDK/AF_XDP)
- UCX/libfabric
