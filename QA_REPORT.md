# QA Report

## Build Issues
- Attempted to build the project using `cmake` followed by `make`. Compilation failed because `src/patterns/zmq_patterns.cpp` includes `<psyne/patterns/zmq_patterns.hpp>` which is not present in the include path. Output:
```
/workspace/psyne/src/patterns/zmq_patterns.cpp:9:10: fatal error: psyne/patterns/zmq_patterns.hpp: No such file or directory
```
This prevents the library from being compiled.

## Source Code Observations
- Several newly added source files are missing a trailing newline at the end of file. Examples include `src/channel/webrtc/data_channel.cpp`, `src/channel/webrtc/data_channel.hpp`, `src/channel/webrtc/ice_agent.cpp`, `src/gpu/cuda/cuda_buffer.cpp`, `src/ucx/ucx_channel.cpp`, and `src/gpu/gpudirect_message.cpp`. Missing newlines can cause formatting issues when concatenating files or generating patches.
- Loops in `EnhancedDataChannel::run_sender`, `run_receiver`, and other background threads rely on fixed `std::this_thread::sleep_for` calls, resulting in busy waiting and potential CPU usage spikes when the channel is idle.
- `GPUDirectChannel::update_stats` uses a static `transfer_count` variable without synchronization, which is not thread‑safe when multiple channels are active.
- Hard‑coded constants are present in network code (for example, `ICEAgent::create_stun_check_request` sets the tie breaker to `0x1234567890ABCDEF`). These should be configurable or generated securely to avoid predictable connection parameters.

## Reliability / Robustness
- The code often assumes successful allocation or initialization without fallback. For example, `UCXChannel` prints errors but frequently continues even when operations fail.
- Many components rely on external libraries (UCX, RDMA, CUDA). When these dependencies are missing, the build system currently fails silently or at compile time. Better feature detection and clear error messages would help users configure the project.

## Orphan Code
- Some factory functions and classes such as `GPUDirectChannel` and `UCXContextManager` do not appear to be referenced in the main build, suggesting possible orphaned code blocks. Review whether these are used elsewhere or should be removed.
