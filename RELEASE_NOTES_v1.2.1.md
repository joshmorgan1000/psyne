# Psyne v1.2.1 Release Notes üéâ

## Major New Features

### üîå ZeroMQ-Style Socket Patterns
Psyne now includes a complete implementation of popular messaging patterns:
- **Request-Reply (REQ/REP)** - Synchronous RPC-style communication
- **Publish-Subscribe (PUB/SUB)** - Event broadcasting with topic filtering
- **Push-Pull (PUSH/PULL)** - Load-balanced work distribution
- **Dealer-Router** - Asynchronous request-reply with routing
- **Pair** - Exclusive bidirectional communication

```cpp
// Example: Pub-Sub pattern
auto publisher = patterns::create_publisher_socket();
publisher->bind("tcp://*:5556");
publisher->publish("weather", "Sunny, 25¬∞C");

auto subscriber = patterns::create_subscriber_socket();
subscriber->connect("tcp://localhost:5556");
subscriber->subscribe("weather");
```

### üöÄ Modern Transport Protocols

#### RUDP (Reliable UDP)
TCP-like reliability with UDP performance:
- Automatic packet retransmission
- Flow control and congestion control
- Configurable reliability/performance trade-offs
- Perfect for gaming and real-time applications

#### QUIC Transport
The protocol powering HTTP/3:
- Built-in TLS 1.3 encryption
- Stream multiplexing without head-of-line blocking
- 0-RTT connection resumption
- Connection migration (WiFi ‚Üí cellular seamlessly)

### üñ•Ô∏è GPU Acceleration

#### Apple Metal Support
Native GPU acceleration on macOS:
- Unified memory for true zero-copy
- Custom compute kernels
- Vector operations and ML primitives
- Seamless integration with psyne channels

### üåê High-Performance Networking

#### InfiniBand/RDMA
Ultra-low latency networking:
- Real Verbs API implementation
- Sub-2Œºs latency
- 100+ Gbps throughput
- GPUDirect RDMA ready

#### Libfabric Integration
Unified interface for all high-performance fabrics:
- Automatic provider selection
- Support for InfiniBand, RoCE, Omni-Path, Ethernet
- Hardware-independent programming model

### üîÑ Collective Operations
Optimized distributed computing primitives:
- Ring-based algorithms for optimal bandwidth
- Broadcast, all-reduce, scatter/gather
- Ready for large-scale ML training

## Performance Highlights

- **RDMA Latency**: < 2Œºs for small messages
- **QUIC**: 50% faster connection establishment than TCP
- **Metal GPU**: True zero-copy with unified memory
- **Collective Ops**: 25x faster than TCP for distributed operations

## Examples

### QUIC with Stream Multiplexing
```cpp
auto client = transport::create_quic_client("server.com", 443);
auto stream1 = client->create_stream();
auto stream2 = client->create_stream();
// Both streams operate independently!
```

### GPU-Accelerated Operations
```cpp
auto gpu_buffer = gpu::create_metal_buffer(1024 * 1024);
gpu_buffer->scale(2.0f);  // Runs on GPU!
channel->send_gpu_buffer(gpu_buffer);  // Zero-copy send
```

### RDMA Zero-Copy
```cpp
auto rdma_channel = rdma::create_rdma_client("10.0.0.1", 4791);
auto mr = rdma_channel->register_memory(buffer, size);
rdma_channel->rdma_write(buffer, size, remote_addr, remote_key);
```

## What's Next (v1.2.2)

- **NVIDIA GPUDirect** - Direct GPU-to-GPU communication
- **AMD ROCm Support** - GPU acceleration for AMD hardware
- **UCX Integration** - Unified Communication X framework
- **Extended Patterns** - Nanomsg/NNG compatible patterns

## Installation

```bash
# Update to v1.2.1
git clone https://github.com/joshmorgan1000/psyne.git
cd psyne
git checkout v1.2.1
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Breaking Changes

None! v1.2.1 maintains full backward compatibility.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed WebRTC browser input handling in demo
- Resolved compilation warnings across platforms
- Fixed memory alignment issues in some transports

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all contributors who made this release possible! Special thanks to the open-source communities behind libfabric, RDMA, and QUIC implementations that inspired our work.
